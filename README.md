# Overview
Schools (generic name I know) is a platform aimed at modernising the current system being used to manage and record student grades etc in schools today starting with primary (and basic) schools. It is primarily a hosted service, meaning we will handle all the setup and maintenance for a monthly/annual fee (A self hosted package will also be made available for schools who wish to deploy their system independently)

# Features:
- School Portal: Each school gets a customised portal unique to that school (e.g. www.schools.com/mannings). It is from here teachers, students and administrators will access the system.
- Student and Teacher database: A database system that holds records of the students and teachers in the school.
- Grades: Students grades are maintained with the ability to show performance graphs per subject etc.
- Reports: Term and End of Year reports can be simply generated with the click of a button. Reports and test results can be automatically e-mailed to parents/guardians.
- Parent/Guardian Portal: Parents or guardians can log in and be shown a report of their child(s) progress and status (which will eventually include stuff like disciplinary actions taken etc). From here, a parent can sign up for term reports and status change notifications by providing an email address (and possibly cell phone number in the future for brief txt updates).
- More features to come (for e.g. mobile apps etc)â€¦ but I am stopping here for now
